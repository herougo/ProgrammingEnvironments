What I did on Linux to set up GitHub SSH Keys (ie require no password)
- cd ~/.ssh
- ls -al # check for existing keys
         # public keys are in .pub files
- ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_github_email@example.com"
  # (save file name as github)
- eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
- ssh-add ~/.ssh/github
- copy the contents of github.pub (this contains the public key)
- # add the key to the github account (ie log in and go to settings > )
- # make sure repository is using ssh instead of https
  For example, a github project like Git will have https url
    https://github.com/<Username>/<Project>.git
  and the ssh one:
    git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git
  You can do:
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git
