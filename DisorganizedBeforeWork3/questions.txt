First day
- what skills should I develop
- meeting schedule
- job evaluation schedule
- number of interns
- what services will I be working on?
- to whom do I assign PR's
- who can I ask questions?

Later
- per repo
  - debugging locally
  - environment variables
- Postman still used? Idea for improvement?
- How to test via Postman
- code bases to learn from
- multiple people
  - what distinguishes a great software engineer?

Eventually
- deploying
- building scalable systems
- AWS
- be able to code the service repo from scratch
- learn automation details (e.g. git test)
- stress/load testing

Specific to work 3
- Why is Quart so cost efficient?
- Is ensure_future needed? Can't you just do this: task = async_fn()?
- answered on my own
  - unittest: mock logger, mock connection
  - protos
  - designing tests
  - doc strings
  - virtual environment used

# Minor

- property in abstract class: return self._colour
  - with expectation of subclasses include colour at top for readability
